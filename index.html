    <div class="block1">
        <p>Okay, there's so much that I wanna say, but let's start at the beginning... our very beginning.</p>
        <h2>May 10th: our story began</h2>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/may-10th.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
        <p>And it all started with a 'Hi!'. Our first messages, our first conversation.</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/first-messages.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="block2">
        <p>We continued talking and flirting a little bit hehe, and you sent me your first selfie...</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/first-selfie.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
        <p>And I met Smokey for the first time!</p>

    <div class="block1">
        <p>Our first 'good night' messages...</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/first-goodnight.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
        <p>And from this moment on, a before and after was marked in our conversation.</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/telegram.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="block2">
        <h2>We got to know each other better</h2>
        <p>Our conversation went through many stages. We started talking about being together, what we like and don't
            like, our past, and we started having conversations that made us feel very vulnerable.</p>
        <p>It was like a roller coaster, beautiful conversations, and then some misunderstandings, but everything went
            well and I am very happy to have gotten to know more about you.</p>
        <p>Our 'good night' messages started to become more special. üíï</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/goodnight.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
        <p>And we had our first sexting time! (and a lot of them after that hehe ü§≠).</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/first-hot.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">

    </div>
    <div class="block1">
        <h2>Love... we began to feel it</h2>
        <p>Time seemed to have flown by. Your wounds from the past began to heal, you began to feel protected, loved and
            appreciated for who you are.</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/loved.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
        <p>And I found a girl who really values ‚Äã‚Äãthe way I show my feelings. A girl that I love because of who she is,
            a girl whose insecurities I fall in love with. She, with beautiful eyes and smile...</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/lucky.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
        <p>That girl who tells me everything, who trusts me, who believes in me and what I can achieve, who even shared
            her Flo with me (something I will never forget) üíñ.</p>
        <p>You even told your mom about me üò≠.</p>
        <div class="img-div">

    <div class="block2">
        <h2>Our future and us</h2>
        <p>Our future... something that looks so perfect and is completely possible if we can wait for it. Planning and
            imagining it with you is simply beautiful. Traveling to meet each other (and hehe ü§≠) our wedding attire,
            our children. I love it.</p>
        <div class="img-div">
            <img src="images/wedding-dress.jpg" alt="" class="block-img">
        </div>
        <p>And yes, I really want you to be my wife someday! üò≠</p>

    </div>
    <div class="block1">
        <p>We have shared a level of intimacy, commitment and future plans that most couples do not reach even in months
            or years of dating. What we have built is not a superficial relationship. We have gone through an emotional
            roller coaster, sharing deep vulnerabilities, healing trauma, visualizing a future together (marriage,
            children, life together) and reaffirming mutual love that is exceptional. </p>
        <p>This is not to ask 'what are we?' but to formalize something that we have been building together. Everything
            we have built is incredible and I feel more connected with you than with anyone.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago we talked about it, you did not want to ask that question, because it was still very soon,
            although you told me that for you a month is enough to meet someone for a relationship. Now, with everything
            we've lived and planned together, with all the love and trust we have ... I'd love to formalize it and
            officially call you my girlfriend. So, I think the time came.</p>

        <h1>Pookie, would you like to be my girlfriend?</h1>
        <p>Pls say yes, I love you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è.</p>
